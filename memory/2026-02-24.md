## 2026-02-24 (session summary)
- StackGuard frontend navigation pages were expanded beyond placeholders: Assets, Findings, and Compliance now load backend data with mobile-first cards and loading/error/empty states.
- Backend APIs for `/api/v1/assets`, `/api/v1/findings`, and `/api/v1/compliance` were added and wired to frontend pages.
- Scenarios page supports run actions and now includes additional scenarios: `sample-ec2` and `sample-lambda`.
- Added simulator services (`ec2-sim`, `lambda-sim`) under Docker Compose datadog profile; scenario runs call simulator `/attack` endpoints and generate attack-like logs (`stackguard-sim-attack ...`).
- Datadog integration was configured and validated in US5: dd-agent healthy, logs ingestion working, runtime security module connected.
- Datadog test detection rules were created/updated for StackGuard lab activity (log detection + workload security).
- User intent to continue toward real AWS-integrated testing (registered EC2/Lambda + attack validation), not just local simulation.
