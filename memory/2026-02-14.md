- User prefers to be called **“Dae”**.
- User wants the assistant to do tasks on the gateway host and deliver results back; **will not use macOS node mode** and the Mac is not intended to be used.

- Notion Direct Upload works via the new File Upload API (Notion-Version: 2025-09-03):
  - `POST https://api.notion.com/v1/file_uploads` creates a FileUpload and returns an `upload_url` ending in `/send`.
  - Sending file bytes must be `multipart/form-data` with a `file` field (e.g., `curl -F "file=@path;type=image/png"`).
    - Attempting raw binary POST (`--data-binary`) returned HTTP 400 `validation_error` (“body.file should be defined”).
  - After `status: uploaded`, attach the file by referencing a file object of type `file_upload` in blocks/pages (e.g., image block or file block via Append block children).
  - To post content into a user’s workspace, the destination Notion page/DB must be shared with the integration/bot (bot user name observed: `mcp`).
