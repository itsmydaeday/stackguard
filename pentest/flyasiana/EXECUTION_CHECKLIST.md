# Execution checklist (RoE-safe)

This checklist is designed to combine **all allowed activities** into one run and produce artifacts that can be directly dropped into the report.

> Note: This document intentionally avoids tool-specific commands. Use your organization-approved tooling.

## 0) Guardrails (must-follow)
- Only operate inside the agreed testing window: **22:00–04:00 UTC**.
- Respect limits:
  - Max RPS: **≤ 5000** (recommend start low and ramp)
  - Max concurrency: **≤ 5**
  - Auth rate-limit verification: **≤ 10 attempts per account**
- Prohibited (do not do): DoS/DDoS, credential stuffing, phishing/social engineering, data exfiltration, exploiting production data, modifying live DB records.
- Stop conditions:
  - error rate > 10% (as RoE)
  - any request from emergency contact

## 1) Subdomain enumeration → inventory
Goal: produce a reproducible `subdomains.txt` and `dns.csv`.

Collect:
- `subdomains.txt` (unique FQDNs, one per line)
- `dns.csv` with columns:
  - hostname, rrtype, value, resolved_ips, timestamp_utc, source

Notes to record:
- wordlist source(s) and size
- whether permutations were used

## 2) Resolve + classify
Goal: separate active, parked, and CDN-fronted assets.

Collect:
- `resolved_hosts.txt`
- `unresolved_hosts.txt`

## 3) HTTP(S) service discovery
Goal: list reachable endpoints and basic metadata.

Collect:
- `live_http.csv` with columns:
  - url, status, final_url, title, server_hint, timestamp_utc

## 4) HTTP security header inspection
Goal: capture and summarize security-relevant headers.

Collect:
- `headers.csv` with columns:
  - url, hsts, csp, x_frame_options, x_content_type_options, referrer_policy, permissions_policy, notes

## 5) TLS configuration review
Goal: document protocol support, cert posture, and obvious misconfigs.

Collect:
- `tls_summary.csv` with columns:
  - hostname, port, protocols, weak_ciphers, cert_issuer, cert_expiry, chain_issues, notes

## 6) Limited automated scanning (low-impact)
Goal: low-impact scanning output with strict rate control.

Collect:
- `scan_summary.md` (what was scanned, when, limits used)
- `scan_findings.csv` (finding, severity, asset, evidence_ref)

## 7) Auth rate-limit verification (≤10 attempts/account)
Goal: validate throttling/lockout/step-up behaviors without brute force.

Collect:
- `auth_rate_limit_notes.md`:
  - endpoint(s) tested (no credentials)
  - observed throttling/lockout behaviors
  - error message patterns (if relevant)

## 8) Evidence bundle
Collect:
- screenshots for key observations (PNG)
- raw outputs (txt/json/csv)

## 9) Drop location for artifacts
- Put all files into: `pentest/flyasiana/inbox/`
- If sending via chat, attach files; they’ll be copied into the same folder.
