# Web Security Assessment Plan (Draft)

This is a **draft plan** designed to fit the provided RoE constraints.

## Phase 0 — Pre-engagement / Safety
- Confirm written authorization + exact scope owner.
- Confirm allowlisting of the test IP(s).
- Agree on stop conditions:
  - HTTP 5xx rate >10% over 5 minutes OR
  - latency p95 > X ms sustained OR
  - explicit request from emergency contact.
- Logging:
  - keep timestamped command logs
  - keep request-rate settings for each tool

## Phase 1 — Passive recon (no direct interaction with target)
- Certificate Transparency enumeration (identify historical hostnames)
- Public DNS / passive DNS sources (if available)
- Tech surface mapping from public artifacts (only if non-invasive)

## Phase 2 — Active DNS enumeration (controlled)
- Resolve candidate subdomains to A/AAAA/CNAME
- Identify dangling DNS / takeover candidates (CNAMEs to unclaimed services)
- Produce canonical inventory table: hostname → record type → value → resolved IPs

## Phase 3 — Service discovery (controlled)
- For resolved IPs/hostnames:
  - Identify live HTTP(S) endpoints
  - Capture status codes, redirects, titles, server banners (where present)
  - HTTP security header inspection (CSP/HSTS/etc.)

## Phase 4 — TLS configuration review
- Enumerate supported protocol versions and cipher suites
- Check cert chain, expiry, SAN coverage
- HSTS preload eligibility (informational)

## Phase 5 — Limited automated scanning (strict rate control)
- Vulnerability scanning limited to:
  - low-impact checks
  - no brute force
  - no exploit attempts unless explicitly approved

## Phase 6 — Auth rate-limit verification (max 10 attempts/account)
- Verify:
  - lockout/step-up controls
  - per-IP/per-account throttles
  - error messaging leakage

## Deliverables
- Executive summary (English)
- Technical findings (English)
- Korean appendix (optional)
- Raw data export (Markdown): subdomain list, DNS records, live endpoints, headers, TLS outputs

## Notes
- RPS vs concurrency: 5000 RPS with concurrency=5 is aggressive. Recommend starting far lower and ramping.
